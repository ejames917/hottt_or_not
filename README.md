## To run the parser
Run the h5_to_csv.py file and specifiy the source/name of the original data source. Keep in mind the machine learning model has trained off of sample data and not the parsed data yet (which is for Checkpoint 2).

Update: Go to the parser/ directory and follow the local README.md there to gain access to and parse the entire MSDS public snapshot on AWS.

## Uploading Jupyter Notebook to SageMaker
To upload to SageMaker, simply go to AWS SageMaker through the user interface. Create a new notebook instance and then launch it. Once it is running, open the jupyter notebook, click “Upload” in the top right corner and then upload the “ml_prototype.ipynb” notebook. An S3 bucket and CSV file must then be specified in order for the notebook to run properly.
